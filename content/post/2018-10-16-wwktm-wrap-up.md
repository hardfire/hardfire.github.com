ðŸŒ¯ It's been 3 weeks since [Web Weekend Kathmandu](https://2018.wwktm.co) and we've *almost* finished all the pending work for the conference. The event was pretty successful and beyond what we had initially planned and expected for.

## Facts and Figures

* ~300 attendees in the whole event
* Representatives from >55 different companies in Nepal
* 11 different nationalities at the conference
* 10% female attendees ðŸ˜¢
* 8 wwktm sponsored attendees (exluding other partial discounts)
* 80 people hiked
* 1 **HUGE** bag of [trash](https://www.facebook.com/wwktm/photos/a.528653844206624/528657844206224/) collected from the trail. We like our trails clean.

## The Conference

The gates opened at 8:00am and there's already a huge queue at the registration desk. The speakers are already at the venue and working on their setup and talk for the day. Everyone's enjoying their sandwiches and aalu fry. It's 9:15am and Ravi dai, our MC for the day kicks off the show. Each talk was really interesting and gave enough to the audience so that they had enough to implement, research and learn once they were back from the event.
There were number of fun moments while the speakers were on stage. Some of my most memorables ones are

* Denis speaking of mining coins that were worth nothing
* Gaurav's random jokes between his talk (or rathar his talk between all the funny tech jokes)
* The whole audience hooting to hear Chathu's full name
* Sonika's story full of up's and down's
* Rob's impeccable storytelling

Even though the internet was patchy at the venue, it was really cool to see the attendees taking on to the social media and posting a lot of fun stories and pictures from the day.
Overall, the day was intense, full of insightful talks and many nice memories to go back and sleep on.

## The Hike

> Hike more. Worry Less. - anonymous

![Lakhuri Bhanjyang](https://scontent.fktm8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/42837675_528654064206602_8850110765760249856_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&oh=ad9ca1b25a65febc319d722c5b43bc18&oe=5C47BEF2)
It's 6:00am, the designated time to leave for the hike and guess what, our venue is not open yet !! Damn, Guard Dai !!! Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.

We reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color - **AMAZING IDEA!!**. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best excercise to get to know other people from our groups.

The main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that's what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.

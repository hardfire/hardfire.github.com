The Web is more than facebook and twitter. It is definitely more than the photos we post on instagram. Our lives are more than that. While our physical lives are in our own control we have been losing control our virtual lives for a tine-tiny bit of convenience. We have been losing ownership of our own content (thoughts, pictures and what-not) while others are selling our data to god-knows-whom and making more tools to push us to create and consume more data and content.

Not everyone is content with the current state of affairs and many folks are taking small/big steps to take back control. I have been happily (but sparingly) writing on this website for about half a decade now but a huge portion of my online life is still in the dark shadows of facebook, twitter and instagram.

I have been slowly moving away from third party websites and trying to take back control of the things i put and see on the internet. Yes, we might have control on the things we post, but we have no control on the things we see and this loss of control is apparently causing us anxiety which in turn makes us consume more content. It's this vicious cycle that most social networks put us in. Sad, but true.

My virtual gurus for ownership of content has been the [IndieWeb Community](https://indieweb.org/). The IndieWeb Community has very similar ideas and have done a lot of ground work to make this transition from centralized web to how the web was meant to be used, decentralized and user owned.

As a reboot of my efforts, I spent sometime last month to setup WebMentions on my website. [WebMention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) is actually a web standard so that websites can talk to each other. Instead of setting up my own WebMentions server, I am using [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/) to manage all webmentions that come to this website. On top of that, I have also setup [Birdgy](https://brid.gy/about) to get social replies from twitter back to the website. This way, even if twitter dies in the future all the interactions would live.

On the side, I have restarted working on my stream application, It has been my tweeting application and bookmarking manager for almost a year. So far It can only tweet text so next I want to add media upload to it. That way, I can first upload tweets and media on my stream first and that can be tweeted later. Added benefit would be that the tweet/post would also be open to receive WebMentions and all the replies on twitter will be fed-back to the stream. That reminds me that I wanted to extend the stream application to accept all my WebMentions as well. Hopefully one day in the future, it would do all that and more.

Apart from the IndieWeb efforts, I have also been actively communicating on another peer-to-peer distributed social network Scuttlebutt. The community has been really warm and the best part is that ownership of content is one of the core philosophies of Scuttlebutt. The whole thought model of Scuttlebutt is so different and enlightening that I enjoy sending patches to different clients of the Scuttleverse.

I have been tinkering quite a lot with the osx dashboard lately and was curious how could one write a widget. I went digging online and found most of the apple links ended up in a 404. Luckily I found [this](http://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/dev/) article, which is a little outdated, but so is the dashboard.

To my surprise, dashboard widgets are written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Yes! right, those web technologies that we've been pushing forward for quite a while now. I hopped in to the opportunity and wrote a very dirty useless app (will post it to github soon). But just in case someone has that weird itch to develop a dashboard widget and would like help, I have included the link to apple's documentation.

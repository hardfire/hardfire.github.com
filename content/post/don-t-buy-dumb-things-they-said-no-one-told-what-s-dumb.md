Yesterday, I happend to watch [this video by Gary Vaynerchuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbupA3iiZAg "Buying Dumb Things Is The WORST Thing You Can Do - Gary Vaynerchuk | Motivational Talk"). It's a nice motivational video. You watch it and then think "OMG! I have been buying a lot of studpid shit and that's the main reason why I'm not a millionaire. This is it!". 

The content is really good, but. But. But! I have one big issue with content like this. They tell you what to do and that generally is true. They never tell you how to make that decision. For example, in this case, Gary Vee, in his "I don't give a shit" style says that we need to stop buying stupid things. He doesn't tell how to figure out if something is stupid. 

Well, that's the journey I set myself to :). I spent some hours thinking how do I make decisions before buying something. How do I really know if something is stupid/dumb. Well, I realized that when i make a buying decision, I come from the totally opposite direction. I sit back, think and try to think if I really NEED this product.

     <p>I have been working on a backbone based project recently and had a situation where i wanted an event to emit only once that too with some restrictions. The way I thought to do it was to do it with an dealy and clearTimeout when required by the state of the application. Everything was fine untill i figured out that the function passed to <code>_.delay</code> doesnt bind to <code>this</code> like the rest of backbone application does, generally.</p>

<p>This is how I solved it, thanks to this <a href='https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/issues/494'>issue</a> on github.</p>

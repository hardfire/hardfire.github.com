     <p>I have been tinkering quite a lot with the osx dashboard lately and was curious how could one write a widget. I went digging online and found most of the apple links ended up in a 404. Luckily I found <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/dev/">this</a> article, which is a little outdated, but so is the dashboard.</p>

<p>To my surprise, dashboard widgets are written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Yes! right, those web technologies that we've been pushing forward for quite a while now. I hopped in to the opportunity and wrote a very dirty useless app (will post it to github soon). But just in case someone has that weird itch to develop a dashboard widget and would like help, I have included the link to apple's documentation.</p>

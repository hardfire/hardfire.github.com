<h2 id='what_how'>What? How?</h2>

<p>I had applied for the leap motion developer program couple of months back and was one of the lucky ones selected to receive the device. The device was mailed via fed-ex and came in a black box with just leap motion written on it. I smell apple-style there.</p>

<p>The device was quite smaller than i had anticipated, about the size of a pack of gums and it is very light of-course. It contains IR cameras that tracks fingers at a very high accuracy (1/100th of a mm).</p>

<p>I was bought by the teaser video the day i saw it. If you have not seen it yet, i suggest you have a look at it first (embedded below). That would surely get you pumped up about the leap motion controller and the power it brings with itself.</p>

<h2 id='device_experience'>Device Experience</h2>

<p>The device is actually very good and precise. It lacks applications for now, and i guess that is why we have these devices shipped to us &#8220;to write some awesome apps&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, what can i do with it right away? Well, to be frank, lots of apps are being developed. The visualizer that comes with the SDK is really nice to get a feel of the device and its precision. Once again, if you have not seen the video for the visualizer, please have a look :) (embedded below)</p>

<h2 id='developers'>Developers</h2>

<p>When it comes to development, the SDK is pretty cool as it has API&#8217;s for development in C++, C#, Obj.C, Java, Python aaannd (drum roll) JavaScript. Yes, it has a WebSockets server that you can connect to and do a lot of stuff. I&#8217;ve seen some demos where developers used the $1 library to give a feel of gestures. The SDK didn&#8217;t have gesture recognition till now, but i hear the new one has some gesture awesomeness, yet to look into that. Me being a believer in &#8220;the web is the platform&#8221; makes me feel good that we can develop Leap applications using JavaScript. No, need to go through learning a whole new technology. That is a win, for sure.</p>

<h2 id='what_next'>What Next?</h2>

<p>The device will be out by May (i think). It will be different and have a better experience compared to the developer kit. I have had some ideas in mind and will start working on it in a week or so. Keep checking for updates :)</p>

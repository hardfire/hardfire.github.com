<h2 id="What-How"><a href="#What-How" class="headerlink" title="What? How?"></a>What? How?</h2><p>I had applied for the leap motion developer program couple of months back and was one of the lucky ones selected to receive the device. The device was mailed via fed-ex and came in a black box with just leap motion written on it. I smell apple-style there. </p>
<p>The device was quite smaller than i had anticipated, about the size of a pack of gums and it is very light of-course. It contains IR cameras that tracks fingers at a very high accuracy (1/100th of a mm).</p>
<p>I was bought by the teaser video the day i saw it. If you have not seen it yet, i suggest you have a look at it first (embedded below). That would surely get you pumped up about the leap motion controller and the power it brings with itself.</p>

<h2 id="Device-Experience"><a href="#Device-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Device Experience"></a>Device Experience</h2><p>The device is actually very good and precise. It lacks applications for now, and i guess that is why we have these devices shipped to us “to write some awesome apps”.</p>
<p>So, what can i do with it right away? Well, to be frank, lots of apps are being developed. The visualizer that comes with the SDK is really nice to get a feel of the device and its precision. Once again, if you have not seen the video for the visualizer, please have a look :) (embedded below)</p>
<h2 id="Developers"><a href="#Developers" class="headerlink" title="Developers"></a>Developers</h2><p>When it comes to development, the SDK is pretty cool as it has API’s for development in C++, C#, Obj.C, Java, Python aaannd (drum roll) JavaScript. Yes, it has a WebSockets server that you can connect to and do a lot of stuff. I’ve seen some demos where developers used the $1 library to give a feel of gestures.<br>The SDK didn’t have gesture recognition till now, but i hear the new one has some gesture awesomeness, yet to look into that. Me being a believer in “the web is the platform” makes me feel good that we can develop Leap applications using JavaScript. No, need to go through learning a whole new technology. That is a win, for sure.</p>
<h2 id="What-Next"><a href="#What-Next" class="headerlink" title="What Next?"></a>What Next?</h2><p>The device will be out by May (i think). It will be different and have a better experience compared to the developer kit. I have had some ideas in mind and will start working on it in a week or so. Keep checking for updates :)</p>

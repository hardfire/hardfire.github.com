            <p>I totally love how Gandalf is introduced in the <strong>book</strong>. This line has been so smartly crafted, I feel awe everytime I read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first <strong>movie</strong>, there is a scene where Gandalf explains why there is a Hobbit with the Dwarves. This line has a lot of signifiance in terms of understanding what’s important in life, the power of mundane daily tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Galadriel:</strong> Mithrandir, why the Halfling?<br><strong>Gandalf:</strong> I do not know. Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that it is not what I’ve found. I’ve found it is the small things, every act of normal folk that keeps the darkness of at bay — simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, before I close this, another well crafted line from JRR Tolkien; this one is not from the hobbit, but from “The fellowship of the ring”. I’ve read it number of times and every time its confusing, but does tickle the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fin.</p>

<p>Chaos is a Ladder — Little Finger, GoT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is to compare and contrast two worlds, two stories that seem the same but totally different experiences.</p>
<h2 id="…-sometime-in-2014"><a href="#…-sometime-in-2014" class="headerlink" title="… sometime in 2014"></a>… sometime in 2014</h2><p>I don’t remember the exact date, but, in 2014 someone shipped me a piece of gadget to Germany. I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.</p>
<p>I went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.</p>
<h2 id="Today"><a href="#Today" class="headerlink" title="Today"></a>Today</h2><p>One month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.</p>
<p>All good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what’s going on in customs land.</p>
<p>Each of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn’t be extracted and they’ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.</p>
<p>I went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was “I’ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here”</p>
<p>Fast forward today, I still don’t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn’t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.</p>
<h2 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h2><p>This process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time. </p>
<p>Our systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end. </p>
<p>This one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better. If there is something that we can do, please enlighten me. I’m all ears.</p>
<p>Update : I did get my shipment eventually</p>

<p>“…our disconnection from what we consume. If we all had to grow our own food, we wouldn’t waste a third of if (as we do now in the UK). If we had to make our own tables and chairs, we wouldn’t throw them out the moment we changed the interior décor. If we could see the look on the face of the child who, under the eyes of an armed soldier, cuts the cloth for the garment we contemplate buying on the high street, we’d probably give it a miss. If we could see the conditions in which a pig is slaughtered, it would put most of us off our bacon butty. If we had to clean our own drinking water, we sure as hell wouldn’t shit in it.”<br><strong>Mark Boyle - The Moneyless Man</strong></p>

<p>Today, Friday the <strong>27th of November 2015</strong> is considered to be the biggest shopping festival of the year, also (in) famously termed as Black Friday. People go out on a limb and buy more stuff than they need, even more stuff than they can consume and even more stuff than they can ever make sense of. Why? Because its cheap and because the rest of the world is also doing it. </p>
<p>Today, Friday the <strong>27th of November 2015</strong> has also been very smartly chosen (like every year) as the <strong>“International Buy Nothing Day”</strong>. The idea of it is not to stop people from buying on this chosen date, but it is to start understanding about one’s consuming behavior and <em>starting a lasting lifestyle commitment to consuming less and producing less waste</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_Nothing_Day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>. People should start connecting with the things they consume, connecting with the people who make them and try to understand the implications of what they buy and what kind of processes they are giving their money to. </p>
<p>The Motto is simple “ Buy what you need, not what you want. “. Our choices has led us to industrialization, which brought a lot of nice goodies and with all the nice came the bad as well. The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world. The only way we can make a difference is by being aware of our choices. I find it funny that we have to pay a premium for “fair-trade” and are very comfortable with the default. Shouldn’t it be the other way round, that all products are “fair-trade” by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as “unfair-trade”. I guess, that would be a good behavioral hack. </p>
<p>These are just some of my thoughts about consumerism. I like the idea of the <strong>International Buy Nothing Day</strong>, pushing us to be better humans, to be a better part of the society, be more aware of the world and our impact to it and taking a step by being the change we want to see. Remember, </p>

<p>So, live up to your principles. Make sure you have some, if not, I think ^^ (up there) is a good starting point :) .</p>

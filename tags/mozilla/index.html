It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like “It’s official, you’re invited! Yay!” and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3730/10223251464_c4320a458b.jpg" alt="Welcome Mozillians, The Brussels Square, venue of awesomeness"></p>
<p>Fast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.</p>
<p>Over the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.</p>
<p>Other than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.</p>

<h3 id="Takeaways"><a href="#Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways"></a>Takeaways</h3><p>Well, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here’s what i got to takeaway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt’ meet all the faces</li>
<li>Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).</li>
<li>A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/quickfolders-tabbed-folders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addon</a> and made it to his contributor list.</li>
<li>Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-Mozilla-Festival-2013"><a href="#Part-2-Mozilla-Festival-2013" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 : Mozilla Festival 2013"></a>Part 2 : Mozilla Festival 2013</h2><p>Another mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2865/10477578876_8de75ceeb9_z.jpg" alt="Mozilla, your light in the darkness"></p>
<p>The first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)</p>
<p>The Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/10477598396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasks</a> waiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/10525736543/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Holy Badge of Hacks”</a>. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.</p>
<p>The third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people. </p>
<p>I think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.</p>
<h2 id="Thanking-them-who-deserve"><a href="#Thanking-them-who-deserve" class="headerlink" title="Thanking them who deserve"></a>Thanking them who deserve</h2><p>Well, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>One fine day (1st of June, 2013) about 75 web enthusiats gathered in Kathmandu, Nepal to celebrate the open-web and spend a day hacking on open web applications, this was the first official event of Mozilla Nepal as Firefox OS App Days, Nepal.<br><img src="http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/315/9j8k.jpg" alt="App Days Nepal"></p>
<p>The registrations started at 8:30 AM in the morning and there were people at the venue around 8:15. In the mean time we were checking if the Firefox OS simulator was setup in everyone’s machines and had some informal talks on the ideas and implementations. At 9:30 AM, we officially kicked off the event with and introduction to Mozilla, the Mozilla Project, the need of Firefox OS and gave a quick demo on how to create a Firefox OS Application, which was a recap for those who had attended the orientation session, couple of days before the event. </p>
<p>Then after, we had the most important part of the day, the application pitching and creation of teams. It is always fun to see the intresting ideas that come out of the audience and it always amazes me how creative people are. <a href="https://gist.github.com/5787159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a list of the ideas that were generated during the pitching session.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/8913494299/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7416/8913494299_be672eb0ae_z.jpg" alt="Attendees"></a></p>
<p>So, we now had about 10 teams working on 10 awesome ideas and 5 hours to hack their way through an amazing app (atleast a prototype). With some major issues with the internet and help from the offline documentations we had, the hackathon started really smooth, but, there was a surprise in stock for everyone. We had a special session for the unboxing and release of the Keon phones that mozilla had sent us. We had the director of Islington College Mr. Ravi Phuyal who gave his precious time to attend the event and honour us by releasing the Keon phones to the audience. (More pics at the flickr stream)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/8913457579/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8546/8913457579_ef694ff603_z.jpg" alt="Keon Unboxing"></a></p>
<p>After this, the hackers were back to the development, and things seemed really serious then, as we had only 1 hour left for the demos. Fast forward to the app demos, at the end about 9 apps were demoed and they ranged from games like tic-tac-toe and love calculator (that app demo was fun) to full fledged applications like guru-chaiyo (A teacher finding service ) and Presentation 2.0  (more on this later)</p>
<p>The team of Wikimedia Nepal had also joined us during the hackathon to work on some of their web-related applications and problems, nothing substantial came out of the hackathon but they did manage to get the basic framework and participation ;) ready for the app. At the end of the day we had a hand full of applications, happy hackers and what’s left was a group photo. (a lot of people had already left by then)<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/8914046284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/8914046284_5d3161b829_z.jpg" alt="Group Photo"></a></p>
<p>##Quick Interesting Updates</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation 2.O was the app demo that made everyone’s jaw drop. The team later hosted the whole source on github (<a href="https://github.com/deepsadhi/Presentation2.O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/deepsadhi/Presentation2.O</a>). The Basic idea was to create a synced presentation tool, so that you can present locally, even in the absence of a projector.</li>
<li>We had 5 hackers joining us all the way from Birgunj. Thanks for joining us and making the event worthwile.</li>

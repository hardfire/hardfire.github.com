What? What does that even mean.
I know, it sounds like an oxymoron; well, maybe it is without any context. But read on, and maybe that will help to give some context to the confusing title.

## Intro

Having lived with and seen number of different cultures in the past years I have one learning that hopefully will stay with me forever. A learning that explains the basic difference between the Eastern(the Indian subcontinent) and the Western(the European subcontinent) thought process.

The east is poor economically which directly leads to bad infrastructure. The governments are far more corrupt than in the west. Those are the obvious ones. I want to touch upon a topic that is more psychological. It is deep rooted in our brains.

## Worth it, but worthless

As humans, we have to understand the worth of our time, our money and most important our efforts. I think this is one thing takes us ages to understand, compared to the west. I spend hours waiting in an government office, its okay, that's how it done here. My doctor appointment at 10am hasn't started at 11:30am, yeah! well, maybe the doctor is really busy.

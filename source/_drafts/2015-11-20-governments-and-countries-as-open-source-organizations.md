Just for a moment, think, what would it be like if governments and countries were open source organizations? The staus quo is that governments are synonymous to big black boxes where no one really knows whats going on unless and until you are part of the big black box. On the contrary, most open source organizations are an amazing expression of freedom and openness. Wouldn't it be great that all the policies would be made in the open, the processes would be listed out in the open and the reason for policies being made would also be available for everyone to understand and reason with.

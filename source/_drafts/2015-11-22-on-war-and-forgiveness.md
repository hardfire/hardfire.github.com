> Forgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course. 
\- Yudhishthir to Draupadi during their exile in the forest

> To get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted... like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgon has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!
\- Yudhisthir to Arjun after having won the war at Kurukshetra

In the recent days, two of the major mobile operators of Nepal have started providing facebook specific plans (be it free or capped at a specific rate). This is not news, wikipedia and twitter has been free for quite some time now. From a short sighted point of view, free facebook is also not technically bad, we are not a country that's running off the revenue of a home brewn social network. Then why the fuss, you may ask?

Recently I've been reading "Self Reliance" by "Ralph Waldo Emerson" and this is just an archive of the quotes and parts-of-text that touched me the most. Iam still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).

> A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.

.

> .. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

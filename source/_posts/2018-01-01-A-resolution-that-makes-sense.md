Reading through HackerNews this morning I noticed [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16044527), which is something that I have been telling a lot of folks in the past days. For the lazy ones, the thread is about 2018 resolutions and the comment mentions the resolution as **" Less consuming, more creating. Doesn't matter what it is, doesn't matter if it's bad. "**

The comment reminds me of something I wrote back in [Jan 1, 2015](http://guffsuff.tumblr.com/post/106802642795/a-resolution-that-makes-sense). I would like it if everyone reads it again and makes it their motto for 2018. **Less consumtion, More creation.**

If you have been drowned in the overwhelming series of posts about new year’s resolution and have come to a point that you have to make one, **make this one.**

The best new years resolution that you can make is to become a maker. We are surrounded by news, articles, blogs, videos, books and the source of information and knowledge is never-ending. But, in between all of this, what we have really forgot is to think, think about stuff and develop a perception about things. This new years, make a resolution that you will be a thinker, a tinkerer. **YOU** will not be a mere consumer of knowledge, but, you’ll make a contribution to the pool of knowledge. It is much better to read one article and think about it; Instead of reading numerous articles and just filling your database of knowledge.

The maker mentioned here is not the type of maker that hipsters are talking about now-a-days [(Maker Movement)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) (* were talking of back then *)

### My Plan

On one hand, I will (have started already) invest more time in documenting things I learn (for myself and others). On the other hand, I have to start policing myself on reading every other article/book/comment. Let's see how that will go, only time will tell.

Remember, It is important to [say out loud](http://avinash.com.np/2015/12/30/Tell.html) what you want to do, the first step to make things real.


### Other folks saying the same
In some cases, same same, but different :D

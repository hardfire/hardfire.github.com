Pantone just announced a new [Pantone Color](http://www.pantone.com/pci/pages/index.aspx?pg=21182&from=hp) named as Minion Yellow. Now, I am very excited to use it in several elements in this website. It does add an identity to the website, doesn't it? Makes it look more fun.

> "Just as the sun’s rays enliven us, PANTONE Minion Yellow is a color that heightens awareness and creates clarity, lighting the way to the intelligence, originality and the resourcefulness of an open mind – this is the color of hope, joy and optimism,"
